// --------------------Event Handling in the DOM


// Adding event listeners: addEventListener(): Attaches an event handler function to an element for a specific event.

// Removing event listeners: removeEventListener(): Removes an event handler that was previously added with addEventListener.
// Event object, event propagation (bubbling and capturing): The event object contains details about the event. Event propagation refers to the order in which events are handled (bubbling or capturing).
// Event delegation: A technique to handle events efficiently by assigning a single event handler to a parent element instead of multiple handlers.
// Common events: click, focus, blur, change, submit, etc.: Examples of frequently used DOM events that can be handled with JavaScript.
